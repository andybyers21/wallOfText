Rice production in Myanmar accounts for approximately 43% of the total agricultural production in the country. making it the seventh largest producer of rice in the world! Out of 67.6 million hectares of land, 12.8 million are used for cultivation.[1] In 2019 alone, Myanmar accounted for 13,300 million metric tons of milled rice production.[2]

Throughout history, Myanmar established itself as a major rice producing and exporting country due to favourable weather for rice paddies and governmental intervention in the form of agricultural policies. The production is undertaken using traditional cultivation methods, particularly during monsoon season- which has led to the development of different varieties of rice. Recent global economic polices have led to increasing international cooperation with NGOs and other organisations, that have provided financial and technological assistance to rice farmers.[3]
