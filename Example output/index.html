          In the year <span class="date">1133CE</span>, construction began on a
          remote hilltop in <span class="name">Castille</span> by
          <span class="name">King Alfonso VII</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the time, the <span class="name"><i>Reconquista</i></span> was in
          full swing and the Christian kings had a policy of erecting Catholic
          institutions on areas formerly owned or in proximity to
          <span class="name">Moorish Muslims.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          The monastery was constructed over a period of many years before
          blossoming into a military and ideological fortress protecting the
          interior of <span class="name">Spain</span> from Muslim incursions.
        </li>

          Today, the
          <span class="name"><i>Monasterio Español de Sacramenia</i></span>
          stands on a busy street in
          <span class="name">Miami, Florida</span> and is known as the
          <span class="name">Ancient Spanish Monastery</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          By most accounts, it is known as the oldest
          <span class="name">European</span> building in
          <span class="name">North America</span>.
        </li>

          <span class="name">Saint Augustine</span>, also founded by the
          Spanish, would not be formally established until
          <span class="date">1565</span>, four hundred and thirty two years
          after
          <span class="name"><i>Monasterio Español de Sacramenia</i></span>
          began its construction back in <span class="name">Spain</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Saint Augustine is the oldest continuously inhabited European
          settlement in the United States. The
          <span class="name"><i>Monasterio Español de Sacramenia</i></span>
          is far older than anything still standing in
          <span class="name">Saint Augustine</span> today.
